# Double Pendulum Simulation

A physics-based simulation of a double pendulum system implemented in JavaScript. The simulation features:

-   Realistic physics calculations including gravity, momentum, and energy conservation
-   Smooth animation with FPS control
-   Motion trails for both pendulum bobs
-   Energy maintenance system to prevent eventual energy loss
-   Color-coded pendulum bobs and trails
